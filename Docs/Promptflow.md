Welcome to join us to make prompt flow better by participating discussions, opening issues, submitting PRs.

Prompt flow is a suite of development tools designed to streamline the end-to-end development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, evaluation to production deployment and monitoring. It makes prompt engineering much easier and enables you to build LLM apps with production quality.

With prompt flow, you will be able to:

Create and iteratively develop flow
Create executable flows that link LLMs, prompts, Python code and other tools together.
Debug and iterate your flows, especially tracing interaction with LLMs with ease.
Evaluate flow quality and performance
Evaluate your flow's quality and performance with larger datasets.
Integrate the testing and evaluation into your CI/CD system to ensure quality of your flow.
Streamlined development cycle for production
Deploy your flow to the serving platform you choose or integrate into your app's code base easily.
(Optional but highly recommended) Collaborate with your team by leveraging the cloud version of Prompt flow in Azure AI.
Installation
To get started quickly, you can use a pre-built development environment. Click the button below to open the repo in GitHub Codespaces, and then continue the readme!

Open in GitHub Codespaces

If you want to get started in your local environment, first install the packages:

Ensure you have a python environment, python>=3.9, <=3.11 is recommended.

pip install promptflow promptflow-tools
Quick Start ‚ö°
Create a chatbot with prompt flow

Run the command to initiate a prompt flow from a chat template, it creates folder named my_chatbot and generates required files within it:

pf flow init --flow ./my_chatbot --type chat
Setup a connection for your API key

For OpenAI key, establish a connection by running the command, using the openai.yaml file in the my_chatbot folder, which stores your OpenAI key (override keys and name with --set to avoid yaml file changes):

pf connection create --file ./my_chatbot/openai.yaml --set api_key=<your_api_key> --name open_ai_connection
For Azure OpenAI key, establish the connection by running the command, using the azure_openai.yaml file:

pf connection create --file ./my_chatbot/azure_openai.yaml --set api_key=<your_api_key> api_base=<your_api_base> --name open_ai_connection
Chat with your flow

In the my_chatbot folder, there's a flow.dag.yaml file that outlines the flow, including inputs/outputs, nodes, connection, and the LLM model, etc

Note that in the chat node, we're using a connection named open_ai_connection (specified in connection field) and the gpt-35-turbo model (specified in deployment_name field). The deployment_name filed is to specify the OpenAI model, or the Azure OpenAI deployment resource.

Interact with your chatbot by running: (press Ctrl + C to end the session)

pf flow test --flow ./my_chatbot --interactive
